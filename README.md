# URQL + Jotai State Management Example

This project demonstrates how to use URQL GraphQL for state management in combination with Jotai.

Originally, this was an alternative approach to [Apollo GraphQL Example](https://github.com/kalyan-anna/react-apollo-graphql-example). However, not fully completed and left midway due to URQL's reexecute functions being less sophisticated compared to Apollo GraphQL.
